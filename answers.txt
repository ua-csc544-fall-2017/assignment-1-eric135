1. When communicating results, it is important to visualize your data in a manner that provides
for intuitive (and more widespread) understanding of one's work. I plan to become a researcher and
foresee this helping me to communicate the results of my work.

2. I believe that we will learn the tools and techniques necessary to properly visualize data in a
manner that leads to more effective communication of the data.

3. C++, C, Java, Python, PHP, HTML (technically a markup langauge), CSS

4. C++

5. I've generated graphs in Excel/LibreOffice Calc. Over the summer, I presented a paper at a
conference in Sweden and had to make bar charts for my slides.

6. The largest dataset I've had to deal with was multiple gigabytes in size. I parsed it with
scripts written in Python (written by me) based on Perl scripts (written by someone else).

7. Likely the interactive maps shown during presidential elections. These maps effectively show
the results at both the overall and state level without requiring any interaction on behalf of
the user. If one wants more information on a particular state's results, they can click on the
state to view it. As a result, these maps are intuitive to use.

8. Probably the magnifying glass one that Dr. Levine showed us during the first lecture. I had
no idea what the percentages within the glass represented.

9. 85th percentile

10. 50th percentile

11. I regularly use Git for my research. I had used Subversion rarely.

12. A good amount (I use it regularly for my research work)

13. A good amount (I use it regularly for my research work)

14. Octopuses have been known to crawl on land (and can survive on land for several minutes at
a time).
